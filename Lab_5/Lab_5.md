## 1 Objectives
Students will choose or design one final experiment which encompasses all previous experiments. Working in groups of two, students will propose to design, build, write code and test, their own Arduino platform based system.

## 2 Introduction

So far, the labs in this course have covered the following topics:
- Data acquisition
- Data filtering
- Serial communication
- Servo and DC motor actuators
- Writing and using Arduino libraries
- Simple feedback loops

In this lab, you are expected to design you own Arduino platform based system which includes all the elements above. You are provided access to all the sensors and actuators in the cabinets for this lab.

Please browse the internet for ideas on systems you could design and build. Feel free to build off examples you find online. A good place to start to get ideas is the Arduino Playground https://playground.arduino.cc/ and the Arduino Project Hub https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub.

## 3 Pre-lab Assignment

Please complete the following tasks BEFORE your assigned lab start time:
-  None

## 4 Lab Assignment
1. (10 points) Describe your project.
2. (5 points) What 3rd party libraries did you include in your project?
3. (5 points) What custom libraries did you write for your project?
4. (10 points) Provide any relevant plots or data for your project.
5. (10 points) Provide a block diagram and/or schematic which shows how the sensors, actuators and Arduino platform are connected for your project. Also indicate what data is flowing along connections and what code is used in each block.
6. (40 points) Provide all custom code you wrote for your project. Also include the names (and links if available) to any libraries you integrated into your code.
7. (10 points) Reflections:
    
    a. How well did you achieve the goals of your project?
    
    b. How does a small Arduino project scale (or relate) to a large Aerospace Industry project?
    
    c. Describe your understanding of how code and hardware work together and interface.
    
    d. How will this basic knowledge help you throughout your career?
