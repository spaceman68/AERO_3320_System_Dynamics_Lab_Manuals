# Lab 4: Regulation and Arduino Libraries

**Closed Loop Control**

## 1. Objectives

Students will learn to connect and gather data from an accelerometer using a library. Students will use the accelerometer data to measure the roll angle of the accelerometer and regulate the armature position of a servo motor. This lab will cover:

- Importing and using an Arduino library
- The basics of object oriented programming
- Calculating the roll angle from an accelerometer reading of the gravity vector
- Regulating the armature position of a servo motor using proportional feedback
